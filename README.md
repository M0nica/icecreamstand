# icecreamstand



In some businesses, such as ice cream stands, consumer demand varies due to uncontrollable external factor such as weather. Yet, aside from offering occasional discounts a lot of businesses choose to set a fixed price for their inventory regardless of varying levels of traffic and demand. On days with better weather conditions an ice cream will receive more traffic and overall buyers are willing to spend more money on ice cream. It is still possible to set a fixed price for ice cream that maximizes profit over various demand levels. 

This project aimed to find a price that resulted in the largest profit after a week of running the ice cream stand with variable weather conditions and thus demand levels each day. Particular price points were looked at to determine at which point increasing the fixed price of ice cream and pricing-out potential customers became detrimental as opposed to beneficial, according to the overall profit. Setting the price way too high resulted in much lower profits than setting the price moderately low.

Default program runs for 7 days (totalDays) with the fixed price (price) set at $3.25.
